      'Created an online game which interacts with Steam items from https://steamcommunity.com. Set up protection from Dos-attack (multiple queries) and SQL-injections. Also, I created a two-factor authorization with Steam account, and created a bot that interacts with other Steam users for Steam items exchange. Web Sockets solve the synchronization problem between players. To animate the Wheels of Fortune, it was decided to use SVG Raphael.js',
